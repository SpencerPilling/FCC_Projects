                <h3>A Brief history about Duke Nukem 3D</h3>
                <p class="small-text"> Duke Nukem 3D was created in 1996 by 3Drealms. This was the third
                chapter of the Duke Nukem franchise, and the first of the chapters to bring a 3D perspective
                to the game. The first two Duke Nukem's were side scrollers. In Duke Nukem 3D, Duke returns
                to earth to find aliens have taken over again. Landing on top a building in the destruction
                of Los Angeles, Duke must start on his journey to rid the earth of another alien race.</p>
                <h3>Episode one "LA Meltdown"</h3>
                <p>In this first episode, Duke battles his way through LA to discover that the aliens have
                been taking the women of LA. When he finds the alien ship, he destroys it, in good ol' Duke
                Nukem fashion. This episode includes a strip club, red light district and a prison.</p>
                <h3>Episode two "Lunar Apocalypse"</h3>
                <p>In the second episode, Duke travels up to space to see what the aliens were doing with all the
                women they had captured. It turns out the aliens were being held in incubators, when Duke finally
                gets to the mother ship on the moon, he destroys the alien overlord. Duke then finds out that this
                was all a distraction, the aliens have started to attack earth in his absence.</p>
                <h3>Episode three "Shrapnel City"</h3>
                <p>in the third episode, Duke travels back to earth to take on the aliens in LA for another round. He
                is able to find the leader of the alien race, the Cycloid Emperor, and ends its life. When the game
                comes to a end, Duke Nukem promises after some R&R, he will be ready for more action.</p>
                <h3>Bonus Episodes</h3>
                <p>There are two bonus episodes that were released after the initial game. The fourth episode
                was called the Atomic Edition Episode Four, The Birth. Then in October of 2016, Duke Nukem was back
                for Episode Five, Alien World Order, in the release of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/434050/" target="_blank">Duke Nukem 3D: 20th Anniversary World Tour</a></p>
